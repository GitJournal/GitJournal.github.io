      <description>Revenue took a bit of a dip in December and recovered in January and is now growing. This is partly because of the Apple Small Business Program, which reduces the commission paid to them from 30% to 15%. I hope Google provides something simliar as half of the revenue comes from Android.

      <description>The last month has been a month full of Ios bug fixes, some task management and a few breaks (More on this below).
For November, financially my goal was a revenue of 800€. This is one of the first months that I&amp;rsquo;ve crossed my revenue target by earning 998.78€.

      <description>Wow, it&amp;rsquo;s been a crazy month. October just flew by. I&amp;rsquo;ve barely managed to make progress on so many parts. I overall feel like October has been far too messy, I&amp;rsquo;m still figuring out the path forward, and I&amp;rsquo;ll share more details soon.
For October my goals were -
  Revenue: 750 €
  Payment via Website
  Here are the numbers -

      <description>Last month, after much deliberation I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to start working on GitJournal full-time, till at least the end of the year. Before this I had been doing a mix of consulting and GitJournal.
This is a scary big step to take. Getting paid from consulting is so much easier than a product. GitJournal&amp;rsquo;s revenue is still far away from covering my monthly expenses, but I think I can get there by the end of the year.</description>

      <title>GitJournal May Update</title>
      <link>https://gitjournal.io/blog/2020-06-12-may-update/</link>

      <description>GitJournal is a mobile first note taking application integrated with Git. It’s based on the idea that you should have control over your data, and that we all have multiple devices in our daily lives, and therefore need to be in control of the mechanism to synchronize our notes across these devices.
Git was chosen as the method to do so, as there are already many commercial provides of Git, and setting up your own Git Server has a much lower barrier to entry than any other setup.</description>
