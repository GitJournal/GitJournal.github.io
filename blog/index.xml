      <description>Last month, after much deliberation I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to start working on GitJournal full-time, till at least the end of the year. Before this I had been doing a mix of consulting and GitJournal.
This is a scary big step to take. Getting paid from consulting is so much easier than a product. GitJournal&amp;rsquo;s revenue is still far away from covering my monthly expenses, but I think I can get there by the end of the year.</description>

      <description>GitJournal is a mobile first note taking application integrated with Git. Itâ€™s based on the idea that you should have control over your data, and that we all have multiple devices in our daily lives, and therefore need to be in control of the mechanism to synchronize our notes across these devices.
Git was chosen as the method to do so, as there are already many commercial provides of Git, and setting up your own Git Server has a much lower barrier to entry than any other setup.</description>
