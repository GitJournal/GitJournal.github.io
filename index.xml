      <description>Hi! My name is Vishesh.
I&amp;rsquo;m the author of GitJournal. I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing open source software for over a decade, and care a lot about data privacy and making it more accessible to the rest of the world.
Long before I started GitJournal, I had been storing my notes and journal entries in plain text or markdown files. It&amp;rsquo;s a simple everlasting format that works with almost all editors. What was lacking was a way to synchronize my notes over multiple devices, while still having control of my data.</description>

      <description>GitJournal is an Open Souce project, and can always use the help.
While code contributions are always welcome, what I really need help with is testing, bug reports, and exposure. So if GitJournal has been useful for you, please tell others about it or post about it on your favorite site.
As always, I&amp;rsquo;m very interested in your experience while using GitJournal. Especially your note workflow and how GitJournal fits into it.</description>

FAQ How do you plan to sustain this project? Sustaining an Open Source Project can be challenging in the long term. The idea with GitJournal is to be a 100% Open Source Project - No Open Core model. Here are my current ideas on how to sustain this in the long term -
