      <description>GitJournal is an Open Souce project, and can always use the help.
While code contributions are always welcome, what we really need help with is testing, bug reports, and exposure. So if GitJournal has been useful for you, please tell others about it or post about it on your favorite site.
As always, we&amp;rsquo;re very interested in your experience while using GitJournal. Feel free to send us an email at feedback@gitjournal.</description>
